# Advent of Code 2022

In 2021, I took on a crazy challenge. I completed each AOC day in a different language.

This year, I'm coming home to my favourite language - Rust.

## Release Plan

If you're reading this in December 2022, I will be releasing my solution to each challenge once at least 24 hours have passed.
